# minor-watt-now
A repository that contains every file and document I used in the project for 'Watt-Now', from the HVA-minor 'Web Development'

Due to the vastness of this project (mainly due to the fact that I work on this project by myself) I haven't been able to inform y'all with the concept, features and technologies this project uses via this README. Keep in mind that I will, once I'm ready for it ;)
